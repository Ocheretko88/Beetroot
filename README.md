# Beetroot Academy C# Homework

This repository contains my homework assignments for the Beetroot Academy's C# and .NET course.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several lessons, each focusing on a different aspect of C# and .NET. Here are some of the topics we've covered:

### Lesson 4: Conditional Operators

In this lesson, we learned about the various conditional operators in C#, including `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`. We also discussed the `if` and `switch` statements and how they can be used to control the flow of a program based on different conditions.

### Lesson 5: Methods

Lesson 5 was all about methods. We discussed what methods are, why they're useful, and how to create them in C#. We also covered different types of methods, including instance methods, static methods, and extension methods.

### Lesson 6: Debugging

The sixth lesson was dedicated to debugging in C#. We learned about various debugging techniques, how to use the debugging tools in the IDE, and how to read and understand error messages and exceptions.

## Getting Started
